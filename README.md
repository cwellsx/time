# Time

Record what you work on and for how long.

## Features

Quick and easy:

1. Open the app and click **Start**
2. When done, add a **Comment** and click **Stop** — or click **Next** to switch tasks without pausing

Useful:

- **Reporting** — view totals by day/week, filter by task or tag, and export your data
- **Tasks & Tags** — attach reusable Task IDs and Activity Tags to categorize your work

Safe:

- **Privacy** — data stays on your machine (no login, no server, no network needed)

## Tips

- Bookmark the app or add it to your browser favorites to encourage persistent storage behavior.
- Use Next to switch tasks without adding a break to your recorded time.
- Predefine Task IDs and Tags on the What page for clearer reports.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing data: confirm you are using the same browser/profile and haven't cleared site storage.
- Persistence not granted: visit and use the app frequently or bookmark it to improve the chance of persistence.
- Always export before clearing site data to retain a backup copy of your database.
