# Help

Use this to:

- Record **when** you start work
- Record **what** you did, whenever you stop
- Review a **history** of what you've done.

## How to use it

The UI needs only a minimum of input:

1. On the Now page, press the **Start** button

   ![Start button](start)

1. Do some work
1. When you finish or pause, type a **comment** to say what you have done, and press the **Stop** button.

   ![Stop button](stop)

   You can optionally also define [Tags and Tasks](./what).

The period and the comment will be visible on the **History** page.

## Tags and Tasks

Maybe a comment is all you need to describe a period, but you can also define tags and tasks:

1. **Predefine a list** of tags and tasks (and define new ones at any time)
2. When you end a period, **optionally pick** a task and one or more tags, as well or instead of a comment
3. When you view History you can **filter** on a specific task or tag

I use **tasks** to define specific projects:

- Tasks end, and when finished they do not recur; I hope to finish many different tasks per year.
- Tasks may be scheduled or estimated in advance.
- You may want to compare the actual time spent on a task with the predicted time.

I use **tags** to define recurring types of activity (for example, "meeting", "coding", "test-setup", and "testing"):

- These activities tend to recur, maybe year after year
- Doing a task might include several activities (or some types of activity are instead of a task)
- You might want to breakdown how much time you spend on various activities

## How it works

You don't log in.
There is no back-end database.
Data you enter is permanently stored **within your browser**.

- That's good for privacy: your data never leaves your browser, no data is sent back to the server.
- It's fast, responds instantly, for the same reason: there's no network delay, it's a local application.

If you have more than one browser or machine, data isn't shared: each has its own independent database.

You needn't keep the web page open when you're working: just bookmark it so you can update it any time.

## Toolbar

Click the toolbar buttons to choose which page:

![Toolbar](toolbar)
