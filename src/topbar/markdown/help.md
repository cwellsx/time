# Help

Use this to:

- Record **when** you start work
- Record **what** you did, whenever you stop
- Review a **history** of what you've done.

## How to use it

The UI needs only a minimum of input, on the [Now](/help/now) page;

1. Press the **Start** button

   ![Start button](start)

1. Do some work
1. When you finish or pause, type a **Comment** to say what you have done, and press the **Stop** button.

   ![Stop button](stop)

Finished periods can be seen on the [History](/help/history) page.

As well as comments you can also define [Tags and Tasks](/help/what).

## Tags and Tasks

Maybe a comment is all you need to describe a period, but you can also define tags and tasks:

1. **Predefine a list** of tags and tasks (and define new ones at any time)
2. When you end a period, **optionally pick** a task and one or more tags, as well or instead of a comment
3. When you view History you can **filter** on a specific task or tag

I use **tasks** to define specific projects:

- Tasks end, and when finished they do not recur; I hope to finish many different tasks per year.
- Tasks may be scheduled or estimated in advance.
- You may want to compare the actual time spent on a task with the predicted time.

I use **tags** to define recurring types of activity (for example, "meeting", "coding", "test-setup", and "testing"):

- These activities tend to recur, maybe year after year
- Doing a task might include several activities (or some types of activity are instead of a task)
- You might want to breakdown how much time you spend on various activities

## How it works

You don't log in.
There is no back-end database.
Data you enter is [permanently stored](/help/settings) in your browser.

- Privacy &ndash; your data never leaves your browser, it is not sent back to the server.
- Speed &ndash; the UI responds instantly, no network delay, it's a local application.

You needn't keep the web page open when you're working, it won't forget your data, just bookmark it so you can update it any time.

If you have more than one browser or machine, data isn't shared: each has its own independent database.

## Toolbar
