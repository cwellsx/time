# Help

- Record **when** you start work
- Whenever you stop, record **what** you did
- Review a **history** of what you've done.

## How to use it

This needs only a minimum of user input.
On the [Now](/help/now) page:

1. When you begin work, press the **Start** button

   ![Start button](start)

   Do some work...

1. Then when you finish or pause, type a **Comment** to say what you did, and press the **Stop** button.

   ![Stop button](stop)

You can review completed periods on the [History](/help/history) page.

And as well as comments you can also define [Tags and Tasks](/help/what).

## How it works

You don't log in.
There is no back-end database.
Data you enter is [permanently stored](/help/settings) in your browser.

- Private &ndash; your data never leaves your browser, it is not sent back to the server.
- Fast &ndash; the UI responds instantly, no network delay, it's a local application.

You needn't keep this open when you're working, it won't forget your data. Just bookmark it to reopen it easily.

If you have more than one browser or machine, data isn't shared: each has its own independent database.

## Understanding the toolbar

Click the toolbar buttons to select different pages:

![Toolbar](toolbar)

- [Now](/help/now)
