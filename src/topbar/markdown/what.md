# What

As well as comments you can also define Tags and Tasks.

1. **Predefine a list** of tags and tasks (and define new ones at any time)
2. When you end a period, **optionally pick** a task and one or more tags, as well or instead of a comment
3. When you view History you can **filter** on a specific task or tag

## Define Tags or Tasks

I use **tasks** to define specific projects:

- Tasks end, and when finished they do not recur; I hope to finish many different tasks per year.
- If you plan and estimate tasks in advance, then you may want to review:
  - The actual time spent on a task, compared with the predicted time
  - What you actually did, compared with what

I use **tags** to define recurring types of activity (for example, "meeting", "coding", "test-setup", and "testing"):

- These activities tend to recur, maybe year after year
- Doing a task might include several activities (or some types of activity are instead of a task)
- You might want to breakdown how much time you spend on various activities

Hint: if you paste a string that's formatted like this into the Task Description...

> Task 123: This is an example of a task description

... then the UI automatically splits that to extract a Task ID i.e. `task-123`.

## Record on the Now page

- After you  define Tasks or Tags,
  these input elements are also on the [Now](/help/now) page &ndash;
  so you can record a Task or Tag, as well as or instead of a Comment, before you press the Stop or Next button.

  ![Tags and Tasks](tags1)

- Begin to type then select the one you want from the popup list.

  ![Begin to type](tags2)

  ![Select](tags3)
