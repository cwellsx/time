# What

As well as comments you can also define Tags and Tasks.

1. **Predefine a list** of tags and tasks (and define new ones at any time)
2. **Optionally select** a task and/or tags, with a comment, when you record the end of a time period
3. **Filter** on a specific task or tag, when you view History

## Define Tags or Tasks

![Tags or Tasks](what)

### Tasks

I use tasks to define specific projects:

Tasks end, and then do not recur.
If you plan and estimate tasks in advance, you may want to review:

- The actual time spent on a task, compared with the predicted time
- What you actually did, compared with what you had planned

### Tags

I use tags to define recurring types of activity (for example, "meeting", "coding", "test-setup", and "testing"):

- These activities tend to recur, maybe year after year
- Doing a task might include several activities;
  or you might spend time on an activity, like "training", which you haven't defined as a task
- You might want to breakdown how much time you spend on various activities

### Automatic Task IDs

If you paste a string that's formatted like this, into the Task Description,
then the UI automatically splits that to extract a Task ID i.e. `task-123`.

> Task 123: This is an example of a task description

To do this the software supports the following keywords: "Task", "Bug", "Requirement", and "Pull Request".

## Record on the Now page

- The [Now](/help/now) page shows additional input elements &ndash;
  so you can select a Task or Tag (and a Comment) before you press the Stop or Next button.

  ![Tags and Tasks](tags1)

- Begin to type, and then select the one you want from the popup list.

## View on the History page

After a task or tag is associated with one or more time periods, then it is shown as a hyperlink,
and clicking on it will show a filtered view of the [History](/help/history) page.

Use this to review everything you did and how much time you spent in total, for any given task or activity.
