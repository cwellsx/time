# History

This page shows what you recorded.

![History](history)

## Sort order

History is shown with the most recent week and day at the top of the list
(i.e. in "reverse chronological order").

The hours within each day are chronological.

## Precision

The length of each time periods, and their sums, are rounded to the nearest 5 minutes for display.

## Editing

If you enable the "History Editable" option on the [Settings](/help/settings) page
then you can edit any period by clicking on it.

- You can edit the text:

  ![Edit Text](history2)

- And you can edit the time period i.e. the Start and Stop times:

  ![Edit Time](history3)

  Using Chrome, click on the little clock item to get that dropdown menu on the "input time" element.
  Or just use the keyboard to type in the new time.

## Filtering

Clicking a link to a Task or Tag defined on the [What](/help/what) page displays a filtered view of the history.
